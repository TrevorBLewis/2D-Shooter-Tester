Welcome! The project title name is "Obsidian Comet"! Unique name right! 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This a vertical shooter where we have a mysterious alien ship looking to save particular creatures
It does destroy other creatures in its path. When it destroys to many creatures a boss creature appears 
Still in the beginning stages of this project and was mainly testing out my overall skills and knowledge of Unity
I will continue to add a few more features but for the most part this is just a demo test type of game.

KEY FEATURES:
There is lots of frame by frame animations
Particle systems
Some tweening applied and a lot of C# applied as a whole
a screen shake effect when the player dies
